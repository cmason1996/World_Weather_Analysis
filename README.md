# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this script is to construct an interface for customers of PlanMyTrip to select their desired vacation spot using the live weather data of the location. Using APIs to collect JSON information we will collect the locations of cities, hotels, and the current weather for the selected city and display the data. Customers will then be allowed to enter in their desired minimum and maximum temperature and the code will do the rest. 

## Results
We successfully collected the data into several different DataFrames; all of which were used to contrust the various Google heatmaps and marker plots that show the data in a more accessible format. The customer may then select any number of markers to see hotels that match their weather criteria out of over 700 cities across the globe. They can then choose up to 23 cities that match their criteria and plot out a route between all of them, using whichever transport mode of their choosing for the trip.
